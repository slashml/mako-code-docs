The Mako Code API provides programmatic access to all Mako Code features for data analysis and visualization. This page provides an overview of the API structure and common patterns.

## Base URL

The API is served from:

```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

API documentation is available at `/api/docs` in development mode.

## CORS Support

The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the following origins:
- http://localhost:5173
- http://frontend:5173
- http://localhost:8001
- http://localhost:8000

## Key Features

### Code Execution

Execute Python code securely with access to data science libraries:

```python
import polars as pl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
df = pl.read_parquet("data/local_storage/example.parquet")

# Analyze data
summary = df.describe()
print(summary)

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(df['x'], df['y'])
plt.title('Example Plot')
plt.show()
```

### SQL Support

Execute SQL queries using the `@sql` directive:

```python
@sql
SELECT * FROM example_table LIMIT 10
```

### Data Management

Upload, list, and manage datasets in various formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Arrow).

### User-Defined Functions

Save and reuse functions across your projects with metadata like descriptions and tags.

### Version Control

Automatically track changes to your code with version history and restore capabilities.

## Response Format

Most API endpoints return a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "error": null
}
```

Or in case of errors:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- 2xx: Success
- 4xx: Client error (invalid request)
- 5xx: Server error

Error responses include details about what went wrong.

## Security

The API implements several security measures:

- Code validation before execution
- Restricted imports (only allows standard library and approved packages)
- Prevention of unsafe function calls (like `eval` and `exec`)
- Linting to catch potential issues

## Available Endpoints

The API is organized around the following main resources:

- [Code Execution](./endpoints#code-execution)
- [File Operations](./endpoints#file-operations)
- [Dataset Management](./endpoints#dataset-operations)
- [User Functions](./endpoints#user-functions)
- [Version Control](./endpoints#version-control)
- [Code Analysis](./endpoints#code-analysis)

For detailed information about each endpoint, see the [Endpoints](./endpoints) documentation.
