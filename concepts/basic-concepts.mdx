# Basic Concepts

This page explains the core concepts and terminology used in Mako Code, your personal Polars sketch pad and analytics workflow.

## Independent Analytics Environment (IAE)

Mako Code is an Independent Analytics Environment designed for data people who love to code. It provides a workflow for fast ad hoc analysis with features to productize your work.

## Code Editor

The Monaco Code Editor (the same editor used in VS Code) provides a powerful interface for writing and executing code with:
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Multiple language support
- Real-time code execution

## Data Management

Mako Code uses a streamlined approach to data management:
- Parquet as the primary local file format
- Apache Arrow for efficient data serialization
- Dataset preview and exploration tools
- Smart file management with multiple tabs

## Polars-First Approach

Mako Code is built around Polars for dataframe manipulation:
- Fast and memory-efficient data processing
- Intuitive API similar to pandas but with better performance
- Direct integration with Polars documentation
- Pre-configured environment optimized for data analysis

## Visualization

Bokeh is the primary visualization tool in Mako Code:
- Interactive plots and dashboards
- Seamless integration with Polars dataframes
- Support for various chart types
- Export capabilities for sharing results

## Workflow Components

A typical Mako Code workflow consists of:

1. **Data Import** - Bringing data into your environment
2. **Exploration** - Examining and understanding your data
3. **Transformation** - Cleaning and reshaping data
4. **Analysis** - Extracting insights from your data
5. **Visualization** - Creating visual representations of your findings
6. **Export/Share** - Saving and sharing your results

## Tech Stack Integration

Mako Code integrates several key technologies:
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, Monaco Editor, TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python standard library
- **Data Processing**: Polars, Apache Arrow
- **Code Quality**: Ruff for linting
- **Data Modeling**: Pydantic

Understanding these core concepts will help you make the most of Mako Code for your data analysis needs.
