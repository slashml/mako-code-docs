## Installation Issues

### Docker-related Issues

If you're having issues with Docker setup:

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is properly installed and running
2. Try rebuilding the image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Python Environment Issues

If you're having issues with the Python environment:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. If using uv package manager:
   ```bash
   uv --version
   # If not installed
   pip install uv
   ```

3. Recreate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   rm -rf .venv # or venv
   uv venv .venv # or python -m venv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt # or pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Dependency Issues

If you encounter frontend dependency issues:

1. Make sure you're using Node.js 20+:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

2. Clean and reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

## Runtime Errors

### API Connection Issues

If you can't connect to the API:

1. Check if the API server is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/health
   ```

2. Verify ports aren't being used by other applications
   ```bash
   # On Mac/Linux
   lsof -i :8001
   
   # On Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :8001
   ```

3. Ensure CORS is properly configured if accessing from a different origin

### Polars Data Processing Issues

If you're experiencing issues with Polars data processing:

1. Check the Polars version is compatible:
   ```python
   import polars as pl
   print(pl.__version__)
   ```

2. Ensure your data files are in the supported formats (Parquet, CSV, Arrow)

3. Verify your data schema is consistent
