# Core Features

Mako Code comes with a rich set of features designed to enhance your development experience. This page outlines the core features that make Mako Code powerful and flexible.

## Component-Based Architecture

Mako Code encourages a component-based architecture, allowing you to build complex UIs from simple, reusable components.

### Key Benefits:

- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across your application
- **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Composability**: Complex UIs can be composed from simple components

## Reactive Data Binding

Mako Code provides a reactive data binding system that automatically updates your UI when your data changes.

```javascript
// Example of reactive data binding
const counter = mako.reactive({ count: 0 });

function increment() {
  counter.count++;  // UI will automatically update
}
```

## Built-in State Management

Mako Code includes a lightweight but powerful state management solution that scales with your application.

### Features:

- **Centralized State**: Single source of truth for your application data
- **Predictable Updates**: State changes follow a strict unidirectional flow
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Ability to inspect and replay state changes
- **Middleware Support**: Extend state management with custom middleware

## Performance Optimization

Mako Code includes several performance optimizations out of the box:

- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient DOM updates through diffing
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for faster initial load
- **Tree Shaking**: Elimination of unused code
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and modules are loaded on demand

## Developer Experience

Mako Code prioritizes developer experience with features like:

- **Hot Module Replacement**: See changes instantly without losing state
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Developer Tools**: Browser extension for debugging and inspection
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support with type definitions

## Build System

The Mako Code build system is designed to be fast and flexible:

- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild what has changed
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple cores for faster builds
- **Custom Transformers**: Extend the build process with custom transformers
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generate code for different environments
