description: 'Setting up your development environment for Mako Code'
---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop (recommended for the containerized approach)
- uv package manager (preferred for Python dependencies)

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhemerson/mako-code.git
cd mako-code
```

## Setup Options

Mako Code offers three ways to set up your development environment:

### 1. Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the simplest approach that ensures consistency across environments:

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Run the application
docker-compose up
```

### 2. Using Make (Mac only)

For Mac users, we provide Make commands to simplify setup:

```bash
# Setup both frontend and backend dependencies
make setup

# Run the application (both frontend and backend)
make run

# To run frontend and backend separately:
make frontend  # Runs frontend server
make backend   # Runs backend server

# To clean up dependencies and build artifacts
make clean
```

### 3. Manual Setup

For the backend:
```bash
cd backend
uv venv .venv  # Or: python3 -m venv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or: pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

For the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI backend with Python code
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the backend
  - `functions/`: Backend functionality
- `frontend/`: SvelteKit frontend with TypeScript

## API Documentation

The backend API documentation will be available at http://localhost:8001/api/docs when running locally.

## Running Tests

If available, run tests with:

```bash
# For backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# For frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Building for Production

To build the frontend for production:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Or using Make:

```bash
make build
```
