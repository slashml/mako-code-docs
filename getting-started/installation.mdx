# Installation

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Mako Code for your data analysis needs.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop (recommended for easiest setup)

## Installation Methods

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with Mako Code is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mako-code.git
cd mako-code

# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Run the application
docker-compose up
```

### Using Make (Mac Only)

Alternatively, on Mac systems you can use the provided Makefile:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mako-code.git
cd mako-code

# Setup both frontend and backend dependencies
make setup

# Run the application (both frontend and backend)
make run
```

To run frontend and backend separately:

```bash
make frontend  # Runs frontend server
make backend   # Runs backend server
```

To clean up dependencies and build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

## Verifying Installation

After installation, the Mako Code interface should be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API documentation: http://localhost:8001/api/docs

## Next Steps

Now that you have Mako Code installed, check out the [Quick Start](./quick-start) guide to learn how to use it.
